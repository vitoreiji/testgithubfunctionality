# Test Github Functionality
This repository is meant to test some github functionality.

Accepting a PR to a branch that is not main will close the PR but not delete the branch, unless the "Automatically delete head branches" option is enabled for the repository. The issue is also not closed.

Some issue has been fixed.

Another issue fixed.
